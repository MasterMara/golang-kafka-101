K8S Security Tools

********************************************************************************************************************************
Security Advices:

--> Security should be redundant
    --> Network, Host, Runtime 



1-) k8s Security starts with building secure images. Build Secure image.
    --> Code from untrusted registtiries.
    -->  Vulnabilarities in tools of OS of libraries
    --> Eliminate Unnecesary packages or dependencies.
    --> Solution: Do Image Scanning, Scan image before pushing to registry. In your CI/CD Pipelines.

2-) Run container as non-root
    --> Build image with dedicated service user.

3-) Manage Users and Permissions.
    --> Keep privileges as restrictive as possible.
    --> Give read-only permissions to my-app namespace only.
    --> Bunun için Role Bassed Access Control yapacağız.
    --> Cluster Role tanımlayacağız.
    --> Use Roll based access to whole structure.

4-) Define Communicaiton Rules between pods.
    --> Limit the Communicaiton
    --> with Network tools.
    --> Create Network Policies. For example Front-end Service only can talk backend service.
    --> Network policies are implemented by the Network plugin.
    --> service seviyesinde bu ayarı yapmak için Solution:Service mash with sidecar Pattern
    --> Use Network policies or ServiceMesh to define strict rules between pods. Service MESH ARAŞTIR.

5-) Encrypt commuications between pods.
    --> ServiceMeshin Enable mTLS between pods.
    --> Encrypt cluster interanl commuications.

6-) Secure Secret data
    --> Stored unencrypted, only base64 encoded.
    --> Eğer Secret kodunu biri görürse base64 göre decode edip datayı görebilir.
    --> Solution1: Use K8S own solution
    --> Solution2: use 3rd party tools like HashiCorp Vault.

7-) Secure  etcd  store
    -->  Put etcd behind a firewall. and allow only api server  access it.
    --> Encrypt etcd data.

8-) Automated Backup & store
    --> Regularly backs up data
    --> Stores backup safely.
    --> INVESTIGATE K10 TOOLS FOR BACKUP YOUR DATA

9-) Configure Security Policies
    --> Her deploy edilen uygulamayı bir k8s admin olarak kontrol edemezsin bunun için deploylarda security policileri tanımlamalısın.

10-) Disaster Recovery
    --> K10 Automated Disaster Recoverysi var. ARAŞTIR.
